# NumPy Practice Repository

This repository is created to learn and practice **NumPy**, the fundamental Python library for numerical computing.  
It contains hands-on examples, exercises, and experiments to understand NumPy arrays, operations, and performance benefits over native Python structures.

## 📌 What this repository covers
- NumPy array creation and data types
- Indexing, slicing, and reshaping
- Mathematical and statistical operations
- Broadcasting and vectorization
- Comparison between Python lists and NumPy arrays
- Real-world numerical examples

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Virtual Environment (venv)

## 🚀 Getting Started
```bash
git clone <repo-link>
cd numpy-practice
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install numpy
