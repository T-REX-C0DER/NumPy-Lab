It contains hands-on examples, exercises, and experiments to understand NumPy arrays, operations, and performance benefits over native Python structures.

## 📌 What this repository covers
- NumPy array creation and data types
- Indexing, slicing, and reshaping
- Mathematical and statistical operations
- Broadcasting and vectorization
- Comparison between Python lists and NumPy arrays
- Real-world numerical examples

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Virtual Environment (venv)
